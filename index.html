<p><em>Subject Matter Expert (France)</em></p>

<p>The project consists of four main steps: (1) evaluating the current lexicon, which includes technologies, IT, 
processes, and governance, (2) analyzing potential technical solutions and their respective architectures, 
(3) creating a strategic lexicon roadmap, and (4) developing a macro backlog for implementation.</p>

<ol><li><strong>Lexicon as-is assessment</strong>: This step involves examining the current state of the lexicon, including the technologies, IT infrastructure, processes, and governance mechanisms in place. The aim is to identify strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement.</li><li>Assess technical solutions and corresponding architecture: Next, potential technical solutions and their associated architectures are evaluated to determine their feasibility, effectiveness, and alignment with the organization&#39;s objectives. This will help in identifying the best-suited solution to address the identified gaps and weaknesses.</li><li>Define lexicon roadmap: Based on the assessments, a strategic lexicon roadmap is developed, outlining the short-term and long-term goals for improving the lexicon. This includes identifying key milestones, timelines, and resources required to achieve the desired outcomes.</li><li><p>Build macro backlog: Lastly, a macro backlog is created to prioritize and manage the implementation of the lexicon roadmap. The backlog includes tasks, action items, and responsibilities necessary to execute the roadmap, ensuring continuous progress and improvement.</p><p>  </p></li></ol></div>
